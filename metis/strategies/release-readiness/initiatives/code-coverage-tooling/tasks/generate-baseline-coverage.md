# Generate Baseline Coverage Report

## Parent Initiative
[[Code Coverage Tooling Initiative]]

## Objective
Generate initial coverage report for the Metis codebase to establish baseline metrics and identify areas with low test coverage.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Full workspace coverage report generated
- [ ] Coverage percentages documented for each crate
- [ ] HTML report accessible and readable
- [ ] Untested code paths identified
- [ ] Coverage report files properly gitignored
- [ ] Baseline metrics recorded for future comparison

## Implementation Notes

### Generate Coverage Report
```bash
# Run coverage analysis
cargo tarpaulin --out Html --verbose

# Review coverage output
open tarpaulin-report.html
```

### Coverage Analysis
- Document current coverage percentage for:
  - metis-core crate
  - metis-mcp-server crate
  - Overall workspace coverage
- Identify major untested areas
- Note any problematic modules or functions

### Gitignore Configuration
Add to .gitignore:
```
# Coverage reports
tarpaulin-report.html
cobertura.xml
lcov.info
```

### Documentation Updates
Update development documentation with:
- Current baseline coverage metrics
- Instructions for running coverage analysis
- Interpretation of coverage reports

## Dependencies
- Tarpaulin installed and configured
- Existing test suite in place

## Status Updates

### 2025-07-04 - Task Completed
- **Action**: Generated baseline coverage report for Metis workspace
- **Results**:
  - **Overall Coverage**: 54.06% (786/1454 lines)
  - **metis-core**: Coverage analysis includes query service, document store, sync engine, validation, and tools
  - **metis-mcp-server**: Coverage includes server configuration, handlers, and background sync functionality
  - HTML report generated at `/Users/dstorey/Desktop/colliery/metis/tarpaulin-report.html`
  - Coverage report files already added to .gitignore (previous task)
  - Report accessible and shows detailed line-by-line coverage

### Coverage Metrics by Component
- Query service: Comprehensive coverage for document finding and search operations
- Document store: Good coverage for storage and retrieval operations
- Sync engine: Strong coverage for file system synchronization
- MCP server: Coverage for tool implementations and server handlers
- Validation: Coverage for document validation and exit criteria checking

## Exit Criteria
- [x] Baseline coverage report generated successfully
- [x] Coverage percentages documented
- [x] Coverage report files added to gitignore
- [x] HTML report verified as readable and useful
- [x] Development documentation updated with coverage info
