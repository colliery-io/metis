# Release Readiness Strategy

## Problem Statement

Metis has reached functional completeness with a working core library, MCP server, and comprehensive agent integration. However, it lacks the professional polish required for public release and adoption. Currently missing: comprehensive documentation, automated testing, CI/CD pipelines, packaging, and deployment automation.

Without these release-readiness components, Metis remains a proof-of-concept rather than a production-ready tool that teams can confidently adopt for their documentation workflows.

## Success Metrics

- Complete API documentation for all public interfaces
- Automated CI/CD pipeline with testing and release automation
- Professional README and getting started guides
- Security review and hardening complete
- Installation and setup process takes <5 minutes
- Zero-config operation for standard use cases

## Solution Approach

Build comprehensive release infrastructure focusing on developer experience, reliability, and professional presentation. Prioritize documentation and testing that enables confident adoption, then add automation that ensures consistent quality.

Focus on making Metis feel like a mature, well-supported tool rather than an experimental project. Every touchpoint should demonstrate quality and attention to detail.

## Scope

**In Scope:**
- Comprehensive API documentation and examples
- CI/CD pipeline with automated testing and releases
- Markdown based documentation.
- Security hardening and review
- Installation automation and setup documentation. 
- Error handling improvements and user-friendly messages
- Code quality tooling and standards enforcement
- Test coverage tooling 
  

**Out of Scope:**
- Major feature additions or architectural changes
- Multi-language bindings or SDK development
- Enterprise features like SSO or advanced permissions
- Complex deployment orchestration beyond Docker
- Extensive localization or internationalization
- Custom hosting or managed service offerings

## Risks & Unknowns

- **Documentation Scope**: Determining appropriate level of detail without over-documenting
	- Minimal. How to set up the server, tool documentation, light technical overview of the current MCP server. All documentation to be concise and cogent. If we can fit it into a single readme we should. 
- **Testing Complexity**: Balancing comprehensive coverage with maintainable test suite
	- Not going to expand testing, putting automated runners and coverage tooling in place is the goal.



## Implementation Dependencies

- Completed core functionality (✓ Available)
- Stable MCP server implementation (✓ Available)
- Understanding of target user workflows and pain points 
	- Known, focus on common mcp configurations: claude and cursor
- CI/CD platform selection and setup 
	- Known, github actions
- Documentation tooling and website framework decisions
	- Known, functional documentation in docs as markdown files. index in the README. no static site rendering.

## Change Log

### 2025-07-04 - Initial Strategy
- **Change**: Created release readiness strategy document
- **Rationale**: Core functionality complete, need professional polish for public release
- **Impact**: Establishes roadmap for production-ready Metis release
