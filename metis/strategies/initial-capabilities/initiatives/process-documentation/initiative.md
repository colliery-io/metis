# Process Documentation Initiative

## Context

This initiative supports the [[flight-levels-mcp-system]] strategy by defining the abstract principles and practices of document-driven development. Before implementing any tools, we must understand the fundamental nature of documents, their relationships, and how they flow through phases.

## Goals & Non-Goals

**Goals:**
- Define the abstract nature of documents and their attributes
- Establish principles for document relationships and dependencies
- Document the practice of phase transitions and completeness criteria
- Define the inherent structure of hierarchical documentation
- Specify how work is captured and tracked through documents

**Non-Goals:**
- Implementation details or technical architecture
- Specific tool features or user interfaces
- File formats or storage mechanisms
- User interaction patterns

## Dependencies

**Blocked by**: None (pure conceptual work)

## Detailed Design

### The Nature of Documents

A document is a unit of work that captures:
- **Intent** - What we are trying to achieve and why
- **Boundaries** - What is included and excluded
- **State** - Current progress and completion status
- **Relationships** - How this work connects to other work
- **History** - How we arrived at current state

### Types of Documents

The system recognizes five fundamental document types, each serving a distinct purpose in the work hierarchy:

**Vision Documents** (North Star)
- Define the fundamental purpose and long-term aspirations of the project
- Establish core values and principles that guide all decisions
- Provide unchanging direction that all strategies must support
- Singular per project - only one vision document exists
- Represent the "north star" layer - why the project exists

**Strategy Documents** (Why)
- Define problems worth solving that advance the vision
- Establish success metrics and outcome measurements
- Sketch high-level solution approaches without implementation details
- Set scope boundaries and identify major risks
- Represent the "why" layer of work - strategic intent and direction

**Initiative Documents** (What/How)
- Transform strategies into implementable designs
- Provide detailed technical specifications and interface definitions
- Document architectural decisions and trade-offs considered
- Break complex problems into manageable implementation units
- Represent the "what and how" layer - concrete solutions and approaches

**Task Documents** (Do)
- Define specific, actionable work items with clear outcomes
- Track implementation progress and findings during execution
- Capture acceptance criteria and verification methods
- Record status updates and blockers encountered during work
- Represent the "do" layer - focused execution and delivery

**Architecture Decision Records** (Decided)
- Capture significant technical or process decisions made during work
- Document the context, rationale, and consequences of choices
- Provide historical record for future teams and maintenance
- Link decisions back to the work that drove them
- Represent the "decided" layer - immutable decision history

**Document Type Characteristics:**

Each type has distinct characteristics that guide its creation and use:
- **Scope**: Vision (project-wide) → Strategy (broad) → Initiative (focused) → Task (specific) → ADR (point decision)
- **Timeframe**: Vision (years) → Strategy (months) → Initiative (weeks) → Task (days) → ADR (moment in time)
- **Audience**: Vision (everyone) → Strategy (stakeholders) → Initiative (team) → Task (individual) → ADR (future maintainers)
- **Mutability**: Vision (stable) → Strategy (evolving) → Initiative (designed) → Task (executing) → ADR (immutable)

### Document Attributes

Every document has inherent properties that define its role in the system:

**Identity Attributes:**
- Unique identifier that never changes
- Type (strategy/initiative/task/adr)
- Implied hierarchy
- Creation timestamp
- Current phase and status

**Relationship Attributes:**
- Parent document (what this supports)
- Dependencies (what must complete first)
- Cross-references (related decisions or documents)
- External knowledge bases (uris to source documents)

**State Attributes:**
- Current stage within its level's workflow
- Completion status of exit criteria
- Last modification timestamp
- Phase transition history

### Hierarchical Document Structure

Documents exist in a strict work hierarchy that enforces decomposition:

```
Vision (North Star) - Defines project purpose and long-term direction
  └── Strategy (Why) - Defines problems worth solving
        └── Initiative (What/How) - Defines solutions and approaches  
              └── Task (Do) - Defines specific implementation work
```

**ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)** are cross-cutting documents that can be created at any level to capture decisions made during work. They reference the work that drove the decision but are not part of the hierarchical decomposition.

**Hierarchy Rules:**
- Vision is singular - only one exists per project
- Each level has distinct purpose and scope in the work breakdown
- Children reference their immediate parent only
- Parent completion requires child completion
- Decomposition is mandatory, not optional
- ADRs capture decisions but don't block or depend on work hierarchy progression

### Phase Flow and Transitions

Documents flow through phases that represent different types of work. Each document level has its own phase progression:

**Level-Specific Phase Flows:**

**Vision Documents:**
```
Draft → Review → Published
```

**Draft Phase:**
- Purpose: Create initial vision statement and core principles
- Work: Purpose definition, value articulation, long-term goal setting, stakeholder input
- Output: Complete vision document ready for review
- Transition: When vision is complete and ready for stakeholder review

**Review Phase:**
- Purpose: Validate vision with all stakeholders
- Work: Stakeholder feedback, refinement, consensus building, alignment verification
- Output: Refined vision with broad stakeholder buy-in
- Transition: When consensus is achieved and vision is approved

**Published Phase:**
- Purpose: Vision is active and guiding all project work
- Work: Communication, reinforcement, strategy alignment verification
- Output: All strategies align with and support the vision
- Transition: Vision remains published (only changes in exceptional circumstances)

**Strategy Documents:**
```
Shaping → Design → Ready → Active → Complete
```

**Shaping Phase:**
- Purpose: Transform ideas into actionable strategy
- Work: Problem identification, solution sketching, risk assessment, scope definition
- Output: Clear problem statement with high-level solution approach
- Transition: When problem and approach are understood and validated

**Design Phase:**
- Purpose: Create complete strategy with child initiatives designed and ready
- Work: Strategy refinement, initiative creation, getting initiatives through Design phase
- Output: Strategy document with complete set of child initiatives in Design phase
- Transition: When all child initiatives complete Design phase and are ready for execution decision

**Ready Phase:**
- Purpose: Strategy and all initiatives designed, awaiting execution decision
- Work: Resource planning, priority assessment, final approvals, go/no-go decision making
- Output: Strategy ready for execution with committed resources and timeline
- Transition: When explicit decision is made to commit resources and proceed with execution

**Active Phase:**
- Purpose: Execute strategy through active management of child initiatives
- Work: Progress monitoring, blocker resolution, scope adjustments, resource allocation
- Output: Child initiatives progressing through their phases toward completion
- Transition: When all child initiatives reach completion and objectives are achieved

**Complete Phase:**
- Purpose: Strategy objectives achieved and lifecycle complete
- Work: Final validation, outcome measurement, lessons learned capture, stakeholder communication
- Output: Completed strategy with validated outcomes and documented learnings
- Transition: Strategy lifecycle complete

**Initiative Documents:**
```
Discovery → Design → Ready → Decompose → Active → Complete
```

**Discovery Phase:**
- Purpose: Explore and understand the initiative requirements and approach
- Work: Requirements gathering, technical exploration, approach evaluation, feasibility assessment
- Output: Clear understanding of what needs to be built and how to approach it
- Transition: When requirements are understood and technical approach is validated

**Design Phase:**
- Purpose: Create complete technical design ready for task planning
- Work: Detailed technical design, interface specification, implementation planning, approval processes

**Ready Phase:**
- Purpose: Initiative designed and awaiting execution decision
- Work: Resource allocation, capacity planning, final approvals, go/no-go decision making
- Output: Initiative ready for task planning with committed resources and timeline
- Transition: When explicit decision is made to commit resources and proceed with task planning

**Decompose Phase:**
- Purpose: Break down initiative design into executable tasks
- Work: Task creation, task planning, dependency mapping, effort estimation, task prioritization
- Output: Complete set of tasks ready for execution
- Transition: When all necessary tasks are created and ready for execution

**Active Phase:**
- Purpose: Execute initiative through active management of child tasks
- Work: Progress monitoring, blocker resolution, scope adjustments, resource allocation
- Output: Child tasks progressing through their phases toward completion
- Transition: When all child tasks reach completion and objectives are achieved

**Complete Phase:**
- Purpose: Initiative objectives achieved and lifecycle complete
- Work: Final validation, outcome measurement, lessons learned capture, handoff documentation
- Output: Completed initiative with validated outcomes and documented learnings
- Transition: Initiative lifecycle complete

**Task Documents:**
```
To Do → Doing → Complete
```
- **To Do**: Task defined and ready to start, waiting for capacity
- **Doing**: Active implementation work, testing, status updates
- **Complete**: Acceptance criteria met and verified

**ADR Documents:**
```
Draft → Discussion → Decided
```
- **Draft**: Decision being formulated, context and options being captured
- **Discussion**: Decision under review, gathering feedback and consensus
- **Decided**: Decision finalized and locked, becomes immutable record


### Document Relationships and Dependencies

Documents relate to each other in specific ways:

**Parent-Child Relationships:**
- Children support their parent's objectives
- Children declare their parent (never reverse)
- Parent completion requires all children complete
- Orphaned children indicate broken planning

**Dependency Relationships:**
- Documents declare what blocks them (blocked_by)
- System derives what each document blocks
- Dependencies must be within same phase or earlier
- Circular dependencies indicate planning problems

**Cross-Reference Relationships:**
- ADRs reference documents that drove decisions
- Documents reference relevant prior decisions
- Related work is linked but not dependent

### Work Practices and Completeness

**Exit Criteria Practice:**
- Every stage defines specific, checkable criteria
- Criteria are embedded in document content
- Progression requires all criteria met
- Criteria can be refined but not skipped

**Completeness Definitions:**
- Strategy complete: Problem understood, solution sketched
- Initiative complete: Implementation fully specified
- Task complete: Objective achieved and verified
- ADR complete: Decision recorded with rationale

**State Transitions:**
- Forward progression only (no regression)
- Transitions require validation
- History is preserved for audit
- Failed transitions provide feedback

### Document History and Change Management

**Evolution Tracking:**

Different document types have different change patterns that require appropriate tracking:

**Strategy Documents (High Change)**
- Evolve significantly during shaping phase as understanding develops
- Require change log to track major pivots and strategic shifts
- Changes should include rationale and date for future context
- Format: `## Change Log` section with reverse chronological entries

**Initiative Documents (Medium Change)**
- Designed once but may need refinement during implementation
- Track design changes that affect scope or approach
- Link changes to ADRs when decisions drive modifications
- Changes typically happen during design review cycles

**Task Documents (Low Change)**
- Primarily additive (status updates, findings, completion notes)
- No formal change log needed - chronological updates suffice
- Changes usually reflect progress rather than scope modifications

**Architecture Decision Records (No Change)**
- Immutable once created - changes require new ADRs
- May be superseded but original decision remains for historical context
- No change tracking needed within individual ADRs

**Change Log Standards:**

For documents requiring change logs, use this format:

```markdown
## Change Log

### 2025-07-02 - Strategic Pivot
- **Change**: Shifted from custom protocol to MCP integration
- **Rationale**: Market research showed MCP gaining adoption
- **Impact**: Reduced scope, accelerated timeline
- **Author**: @username

### 2025-06-15 - Scope Expansion  
- **Change**: Added CLI management interface
- **Rationale**: User feedback indicated need for non-AI access
- **Impact**: Added 2 weeks to timeline, new initiative needed
- **Author**: @username
```

**Change Governance:**

- **Significant Changes**: Require stakeholder review and approval
- **Minor Refinements**: Can be made by document owner with notification
- **Breaking Changes**: Changes that invalidate child documents require cascade review
- **Change Approval**: Document in change log who approved and when

**Change Documentation:**

- Document change logs capture the "why" and "what" of significant changes
- Change entries should be self-contained and understandable without external context
- Include both the rationale for changes and their impact on scope or approach
- Changes are recorded as they happen, not retrospectively reconstructed

### Document Content Structure

Each document type has prescribed content areas:

**Strategy Documents:**
- Problem statement (why this matters)
- Success metrics (how we measure achievement)
- Solution approach (high-level how)
- Scope boundaries (what's included/excluded)
- Risk assessment (what could go wrong)

**Initiative Documents:**
- Context (parent strategy and role)
- Goals and non-goals (specific objectives)
- Detailed design (technical specifications)
- Alternatives considered (options rejected)
- Implementation plan (how to execute)

**Task Documents:**
- Parent initiative (what this supports)
- Objective (specific outcome needed)
- Acceptance criteria (definition of done)
- Implementation notes (findings during work)
- Status updates (progress tracking)

### Quality Gates and Validation

**Phase Transition Validation:**
- Each phase transition represents a quality gate requiring validation
- Teams define their own transition criteria based on their culture and needs
- Validation ensures work is genuinely ready for the next phase, not just time-boxed
- Transition criteria should be explicit and checkable, not subjective feelings

**Relationship Validation:**
- All children have valid parents
- Dependencies form directed acyclic graph
- Cross-references point to existing documents
- Hierarchy respects level constraints

**Content Validation:**
- Required sections are present and complete
- Exit criteria are specific and checkable
- Decisions have clear rationale
- Objectives are measurable

## Implementation Plan

1. **Document Foundations** - Define abstract document model and attributes
2. **Relationship Principles** - Establish how documents connect and depend
3. **Phase Flow Rules** - Specify transition criteria and validation
4. **Content Standards** - Define required sections and quality gates
5. **Validation Framework** - Create checks for relationship and content integrity
