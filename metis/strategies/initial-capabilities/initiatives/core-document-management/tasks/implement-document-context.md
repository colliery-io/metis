# Implement DocumentContext and Validation

## Parent Initiative

[[Core Document Management Library]]

## Objective

Implement the DocumentContext struct based on the template requirements defined in the Template Definition System task.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] DocumentContext struct matching template variable needs
- [x] Validation methods based on template requirements
- [x] Error handling for missing required template variables
- [x] Helper methods for template variable generation (slug, timestamps, etc.)
- [x] Unit tests for validation scenarios
- [x] Integration with template engine

## Implementation Notes

Structure and validation rules will be determined after template definition is complete to ensure exact alignment with template needs.
