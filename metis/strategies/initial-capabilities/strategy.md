# Initial Capabilities Strategy

## Problem Statement

The Metis methodology exists as documented templates and processes, but lacks the foundational core functions to actually create, validate, and transition documents through their defined phases. Without basic programmatic capabilities for document creation, phase validation, and workflow management, teams cannot practically adopt Metis beyond manual markdown file management. This creates a significant barrier to proving the methodology's value and achieving the vision of seamless documentation integration with development workflows.

The core problem is the gap between having well-defined document templates and having the core functionality that makes those templates programmatically manageable across any interface or integration.

## Success Metrics

- Core functions exist for creating all document types with proper frontmatter and relationships
- Core functions can validate exit criteria completion and enforce phase transition rules
- Core functions can track and validate parent-child document relationships
- Core functions support document change tracking and history management
- Complete document lifecycle can be demonstrated programmatically on actual Metis project
- Core functionality enables multiple interface implementations (CLI, MCP, web, etc.)

## Solution Approach

Build core document management functions that provide the foundational capabilities for Metis adoption:

1. **Document Creation Functions**: Core logic to generate documents from templates with proper IDs, frontmatter, and relationships
2. **Phase Management Functions**: Validate exit criteria completion and enforce phase transition rules programmatically
3. **Relationship Management Functions**: Track and validate parent-child relationships, detect orphaned documents
4. **Change Tracking Functions**: Store document history and track evolution over time
5. **Storage Abstraction**: Support both filesystem and database storage for metadata and search indexing

Focus on building the core engine that can support any interface (CLI, MCP server, web UI, IDE plugins) rather than prescribing specific user interactions. The goal is to prove the methodology works through solid programmatic foundations.

## Scope

**In Scope:**
- Core functions for document creation, validation, and lifecycle management
- Phase transition logic and exit criteria validation
- Document relationship tracking and validation
- Change tracking and document history management
- Storage abstraction supporting filesystem and database approaches
- Example implementation demonstrating full Metis adoption (using this project itself)

**Out of Scope:**
- Specific user interfaces (CLI, web, etc.) - these are separate initiatives
- Real-time collaboration features
- Advanced reporting or analytics beyond basic document queries
- Integration with external project management tools beyond core data exchange
- Documentation hosting, publishing, or presentation systems

## Risks & Unknowns

- **API Design Complexity**: Risk of over-engineering core functions and creating complex interfaces instead of simple, focused functionality
- **Storage Performance**: Unknown performance characteristics of different storage approaches (filesystem vs database) for typical Metis usage patterns
- **Template Evolution**: Current templates may need refinement based on practical usage, requiring core function updates
- **Integration Barriers**: Uncertainty about what level of programmatic access is sufficient for different interface implementations
- **Change Tracking Overhead**: Unknown storage and performance impact of maintaining document history and change tracking

## Exit Criteria

- [x] Problem statement is clear and agreed upon
- [x] Success metrics are measurable and defined
- [x] Solution approach is sketched at high level
- [x] Scope boundaries are documented and validated
- [x] Major risks are identified and assessed

## Implementation Dependencies

This strategy depends on:
- Completed document templates and process documentation (âœ“ Complete)
- Analysis of storage approaches (filesystem vs database) for metadata and indexing
- Understanding of core function requirements across potential interface implementations
- Programming language and framework decisions for core function implementation

## Change Log

### 2025-07-02 - Initial Strategy
- **Change**: Created initial strategy document
- **Rationale**: Need foundational capabilities to move from documented process to practical methodology
- **Impact**: Establishes roadmap for minimal viable tooling to enable Metis adoption
- **Next Review**: 2025-12-31

### 2025-07-02 - Shift from CLI to Core Functions
- **Change**: Refocused strategy from CLI tooling to core document management functions
- **Rationale**: Better architectural separation between functionality and interface, enables multiple interface implementations
- **Impact**: Strategy now focuses on building the engine rather than prescribing specific user interactions
- **Next Review**: 2025-12-31

### 2025-07-02 - Move to Design Phase
- **Change**: Transitioned from Shaping to Design phase after exit criteria completion
- **Rationale**: Problem, approach, and scope are well-defined and ready for detailed design work
- **Impact**: Ready to create initiatives that will implement the core functionality
- **Next Review**: 2025-12-31
