# Semantic Search & RAG Strategy

## Problem Statement

Current Metis search is limited to basic text matching and SQL queries, which fails to capture semantic relationships between documents and concepts. Users cannot find documents based on conceptual similarity, related ideas, or contextual meaning. This limits the effectiveness of both human users and AI agents when exploring large documentation hierarchies.

Without semantic search capabilities, users must rely on exact keyword matches or manual navigation through document hierarchies. AI agents lack the ability to understand document relationships, find relevant context for decision-making, or provide intelligent recommendations based on semantic similarity.

## Success Metrics

- Semantic similarity search with <200ms response time
- Local embedding generation requiring no external API calls
- Support for 1000+ documents with sub-second search performance
- AI agent integration for intelligent document discovery
- Cross-document concept linking and relationship mapping
- Semantic clustering of related documents and decisions
- Multi-modal search supporting both queries and document-to-document similarity
- Offline operation with no dependency on cloud services
- Memory-efficient operation suitable for developer workstations

## Solution Approach

Build a fully local semantic search system using open-source embedding models that can run efficiently on developer machines. Focus on document-to-document relationships, conceptual similarity, and intelligent context discovery without requiring cloud dependencies.

Implement a hybrid approach combining traditional keyword search with semantic similarity to provide both precise and contextual results. Integrate seamlessly with existing MCP tools while adding new semantic discovery capabilities.

## Scope

**In Scope:**
- Local embedding model integration (e.g., all-MiniLM-L6-v2, BGE-small)
- Document embedding generation and storage in SQLite
- Semantic similarity search with configurable thresholds
- Hybrid search combining keywords and semantic similarity
- Document-to-document relationship discovery
- MCP tools for semantic search and discovery
- Incremental embedding updates synchronized with file changes
- Concept clustering and thematic grouping
- Chunking and processing strategies.
- Performance optimization for large document sets
- Integration with existing sync engine for automatic updates

**Out of Scope:**
- Large language model integration or text generation
- Cloud-based embedding services or external API dependencies
- Multi-language support beyond English
- Complex NLP preprocessing beyond basic text extraction
- Real-time collaborative search or multi-user features
- Custom embedding model training or fine-tuning
- Advanced analytics or reporting dashboards
- Integration with external knowledge bases

## Risks & Unknowns

- **Model Size vs Performance**: Balancing embedding quality with memory/CPU requirements
- **Storage Requirements**: Vector storage size and performance impact on SQLite
- **Embedding Quality**: Ensuring semantic relevance for technical documentation
- **Performance Scaling**: Maintaining speed with large document collections
- **Model Selection**: Choosing optimal embedding model for documentation use case
- **Update Complexity**: Efficiently updating embeddings as documents change
- **Resource Usage**: Memory and CPU impact on developer machines

## Implementation Dependencies

- Completed sync engine for document change detection (âœ“ Available)
- SQLite storage with vector extension capabilities
	- sqlite-vec (via rust init)
- Rust ML/embedding library selection (candle, ort, tch)
	- rig + extensions
- Performance benchmarking framework for optimization
	- this will run in the "background" (like our sync engine) so as long as its not eating up GB of ram constantly we're "ok"
- Understanding of typical Metis document sizes and vocabularies
	- this will be highly dependent on the user and project but because metis is a fairly narrow system around the creation of software planning and implementation documents , semantically everything should be fairly narrow.
