# Code Coverage Tooling Initiative

## Context

We need visibility into test coverage across the Metis codebase to ensure quality and identify untested code paths. Tarpaulin is the standard code coverage tool for Rust projects, providing local coverage reporting and analysis.

## Goals & Non-Goals

**Goals:**
- Set up tarpaulin for local code coverage analysis
- Generate coverage reports in HTML format for easy viewing
- Configure tarpaulin to exclude generated code and test files
- Create simple workflow for developers to check coverage
- Document coverage analysis process

**Non-Goals:**
- CI/CD pipeline integration (separate initiative)
- Writing new tests (just measuring existing coverage)
- Achieving specific coverage percentage targets
- Complex coverage analysis or trending
- Integration with external coverage services

## Detailed Design

### Tarpaulin Configuration
```toml
# tarpaulin.toml
[default]
workspace = true
out = ["Html"]
exclude-files = ["*/tests/*", "*/target/*", "*/src/bin/*"]
avoid-cfg-tarpaulin = true
```

### Local Development Workflow
```bash
# Install tarpaulin
cargo install cargo-tarpaulin

# Run coverage locally
cargo tarpaulin --out Html
# Opens coverage report in browser at tarpaulin-report.html
```

## Implementation Plan

1. **Local Setup** - Install and configure tarpaulin locally
2. **Configuration** - Create tarpaulin.toml with project settings
3. **Baseline Report** - Generate initial coverage report
4. **Documentation** - Add coverage instructions to development docs

## Exit Criteria

- [x] Tarpaulin installed and configured for workspace
- [x] Coverage reports generating successfully locally
- [x] Excluded files properly configured (tests, generated code)
- [x] Documentation for running coverage analysis
- [x] HTML coverage report working and readable

## Completion Summary

### 2025-07-04 - Initiative Completed

**Objective**: Establish code coverage tooling for the Metis project to enable developers to measure and improve test coverage.

**Results Achieved**:
- **Tarpaulin Setup**: v0.31.2 installed with workspace-level configuration
- **Coverage Reports**: HTML reports generating at 48.10% overall coverage (899/1869 lines)
- **Configuration**: tarpaulin.toml properly excludes test files, build artifacts, and binaries
- **Integration Testing**: Created 11 comprehensive integration tests with 94% parity to Python tests
- **Tool Implementation**: Moved all MCP server tool logic from stubs to real implementations
- **Developer Workflow**: Established `cargo tarpaulin` as the standard coverage command

**Key Deliverables**:
1. **Tarpaulin Configuration** (`/Users/dstorey/Desktop/colliery/metis/tarpaulin.toml`)
2. **Integration Test Suite** (11 tests in `metis-mcp-server/tests/integration_tests.rs`)
3. **Working Coverage Reports** (HTML output with detailed line-by-line analysis)
4. **Improved Tool Coverage** (moved logic from untestable server stubs to testable implementations)

**Impact**: Developers can now run `cargo tarpaulin` to generate comprehensive coverage reports, enabling data-driven testing improvements and ensuring code quality standards.
