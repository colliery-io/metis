# Install and Configure Tarpaulin

## Parent Initiative
[[Code Coverage Tooling Initiative]]

## Objective
Install cargo-tarpaulin and create basic configuration for the Metis workspace to enable local code coverage analysis.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] cargo-tarpaulin installed locally
- [ ] tarpaulin.toml configuration file created
- [ ] Configuration excludes test files and generated code
- [ ] HTML output format configured
- [ ] Basic coverage report generation working
- [ ] Workspace-level coverage analysis functional

## Implementation Notes

### Installation
```bash
cargo install cargo-tarpaulin
```

### Configuration File (tarpaulin.toml)
```toml
[default]
workspace = true
out = ["Html"]
exclude-files = ["*/tests/*", "*/target/*", "*/src/bin/*"]
avoid-cfg-tarpaulin = true
```

### Basic Usage Test
```bash
# Generate coverage report
cargo tarpaulin --out Html

# Verify HTML report created
ls tarpaulin-report.html
```

### Files to Exclude
- Test files: `*/tests/*`
- Build artifacts: `*/target/*` 
- Binary targets: `*/src/bin/*`
- Generated code (if any)

## Dependencies
- Rust toolchain installed
- Metis workspace with existing tests

## Status Updates
*To be added during implementation*
