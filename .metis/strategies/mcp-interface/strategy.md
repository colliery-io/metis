# MCP Interface for Agent Integration Strategy

## Problem Statement

The Metis core document management library is complete but currently only accessible programmatically through direct Rust API calls. AI agents and external tools need a standardized interface to create, validate, transition, and query Metis documents. Without an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, agents cannot leverage the Metis methodology for structured document management in their workflows.

This creates a gap between our  core capabilities and practical agent usage, limiting adoption and preventing agents from following the Metis methodology for their own project documentation needs.

## Success Metrics

- MCP server successfully exposes all core Metis functions
- Agents can create documents through MCP calls
- Agents can validate and transition document phases
- Agents can query and search existing documents
- Response times under 100ms for typical operations
- Clear error handling and validation feedback to agents

## Solution Approach

Build an MCP server that wraps the Metis core library, exposing document management capabilities through standardized MCP tools. The server will provide a clean, type-safe interface for agents while leveraging all existing validation, phase management, and storage functionality.

Focus on essential operations that agents need most: document creation, validation, phase transitions, and querying. Maintain the same business rules and validation that exist in the core library.

## Scope

**In Scope:**
- MCP server implementation wrapping Metis core functions
- Document creation tools (render documents from templates)
- Document validation tools (validate frontmatter and structure)
- Phase transition tools (move documents through lifecycle)
- Exit criteria tools (check completion status)
- Document querying tools (search, list, get by ID)
- Basic configuration and setup
- Error handling and clear agent feedback

**Out of Scope:**
- Advanced workflow automation or orchestration
- Custom template creation through MCP interface
- Real-time collaboration or multi-agent coordination
- Complex reporting or analytics
- Direct database administration
- File system management beyond document operations

## Risks & Unknowns

- **MCP Protocol Complexity**: Need to understand MCP server implementation patterns and best practices
- **Performance**: Ensuring MCP overhead doesn't significantly impact response times
- **Error Handling**: Translating Rust errors into meaningful MCP responses for agents
- **Agent Adoption**: Unknown how agents will actually use these capabilities in practice
- **Configuration Management**: How agents specify vault paths and project settings

## Implementation Dependencies

- Completed Metis core library (✓ Available)
- MCP server framework selection and setup
- Understanding of agent usage patterns and requirements
- Testing with actual agent integrations

## Change Log

### 2025-07-03 - Initial Strategy
- **Change**: Created initial MCP interface strategy document
- **Rationale**: Core library is complete, need agent-accessible interface to enable practical usage
- **Impact**: Establishes roadmap for making Metis methodology available to AI agents
- **Next Review**: 2025-12-31

## Implementation Summary

**Strategy Completed Successfully**

All 4 initiatives have been completed, delivering a fully functional MCP server that exposes the complete Metis methodology to AI agents:

1. ✅ **Project Initialization Management** - Agents can initialize new Metis projects
2. ✅ **Document Update Management** - Surgical document updates (content, exit criteria, blocked_by)
3. ✅ **Agent Methodology Guidance** - Comprehensive Flight Levels instructions on startup
4. ✅ **MCP Server Implementation** - Complete server with 11 tools covering all operations

**Key Achievements:**
- MCP server successfully exposes all core Metis functions
- Agents receive comprehensive methodology guidance on connection
- Direct path approach eliminates workspace complexity
- 11 MCP tools covering project, document, update, phase, and query operations
- Comprehensive testing and validation completed
