# CI/CD Platform Initiative

## Context

We need to establish a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions that supports a "direct to main + tag release" SDLC. This approach allows continuous integration to main branch with automated releases triggered by git tags.

## Goals & Non-Goals

**Goals:**
- Set up GitHub Actions for continuous integration
- Implement "direct to main" workflow (no feature branches required)
- Create automated release process triggered by git tags
- Run tests and quality checks on every push to main
- Generate and publish releases automatically
- Integrate with existing tooling (cargo, tarpaulin, angreal)

**Non-Goals:**
- Complex branching strategies or pull request workflows
- Manual release processes
- Multiple environment deployments
- Advanced deployment orchestration
- Integration with external CI/CD platforms

## Workflow Design

### Direct to Main SDLC
```
Developer commits → Push to main → CI runs → Tests pass → Code deployed
                                                      ↓
Tag push (v1.0.0) → Release workflow → Build artifacts → Publish release
```

### GitHub Actions Workflows

**Continuous Integration** (on push to main):
- Run tests across workspace
- Execute linting and formatting checks
- Generate coverage reports
- Run angreal quality checks

**Release** (on tag push):
- Build release artifacts
- Create GitHub release
- Publish crates to crates.io (if applicable)
- Generate release notes

## Implementation Plan

1. **CI Workflow** - Create basic CI pipeline for main branch
2. **Quality Gates** - Integrate testing and linting checks
3. **Release Workflow** - Set up tag-triggered release automation
4. **Integration** - Connect with tarpaulin and angreal tooling
5. **Documentation** - Document release process and workflows
6. **Testing** - Validate workflows with test releases

## Exit Criteria

- [x] GitHub Actions CI workflow running on main branch pushes
- [x] All tests and quality checks passing in CI
- [x] Tag-triggered release workflow implemented
- [x] Automated release creation and artifact publishing
- [x] Integration with coverage and angreal tooling
- [x] Documentation for release process and tagging

## Completion Summary

### 2025-07-04 - Initiative Completed

**Objective**: Establish a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions that supports a "direct to main + tag release" SDLC approach.

**Results Achieved**:
- **Direct to Main Workflow**: Implemented simple SDLC with no feature branches required
- **Comprehensive CI Pipeline**: Automated testing, linting, coverage, and security checks on every main push
- **Automated Release Process**: Tag-triggered releases with multi-platform binary builds
- **Angreal Integration**: Full integration with existing angreal command tooling
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Release artifacts for Linux, macOS, and Windows
- **Crates.io Publishing**: Automated publishing to Rust package registry for stable releases

**Key Deliverables**:
1. **CI Workflow** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`):
   - Test suite execution with angreal
   - Quality checks (clippy, rustfmt) with angreal check
   - Code coverage reporting with tarpaulin and Codecov integration
   - Security audit with cargo-audit
   - Parallel job execution for fast feedback

2. **Release Workflow** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`):
   - Tag-triggered automation (v*.*.* pattern)
   - Cross-platform binary builds (Linux, macOS, Windows)
   - Automated GitHub release creation with generated notes
   - Artifact packaging and upload
   - Conditional crates.io publishing for stable releases

3. **Process Documentation**: 
   - Complete release process documentation in README
   - Version tagging conventions (semantic versioning)
   - Development workflow explanation
   - CI/CD pipeline overview

**SDLC Flow**:
```
Developer commits → Push to main → CI runs → Tests pass → Ready for release
                                                      ↓
Tag push (v1.0.0) → Release workflow → Build artifacts → Publish release
```

**Impact**: Metis now has a fully automated CI/CD pipeline enabling rapid, reliable releases with comprehensive quality gates and multi-platform distribution.
