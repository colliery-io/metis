# User Experience Enhancement Strategy Strategy

## Problem Statement

The Metis TUI currently lacks comprehensive user feedback mechanisms, making it difficult for users to understand the status of their operations, whether actions succeeded or failed, and what errors might have occurred. This results in a poor user experience where users are left guessing about the system's state.

## Success Metrics

- Users receive immediate feedback for all operations (100% coverage)
- Error messages are actionable and help users resolve issues
- Feedback is displayed within 100ms of operation completion
- Users can easily distinguish between success, error, warning, and info messages
- Message display doesn't obstruct critical UI elements

## Solution Approach

Enhance the TUI's user experience by implementing clear, contextual feedback mechanisms that inform users about:
- Operation results (success/failure)
- Error messages with actionable information
- Progress indicators for long-running operations
- System state changes and transitions

The approach will focus on non-intrusive, accessible feedback that doesn't disrupt the user's workflow while providing valuable real-time information.

## Scope

**In Scope:**
- Message display area in TUI (errors, success, warnings, info)
- Message lifecycle management (display, duration, clearing)
- Keyboard shortcuts for message management
- Integration with existing error handling
- Visual distinction between message types
- Message history tracking

**Out of Scope:**
- Complete TUI redesign
- Logging to external files
- Network-based error reporting
- Complex animations or transitions
- Multi-language support (for now)

## Risks & Unknowns

- Performance impact of frequent UI redraws for message updates
- Optimal message display duration for different message types
- Handling message overflow when multiple operations occur rapidly
- Integration complexity with existing error handling patterns
- Screen real estate constraints on smaller terminal windows

## Implementation Dependencies

Critical path:
1. Design and implement message model system
2. Integrate message state into UI state management
3. Create message rendering component
4. Update main UI layout to accommodate message area
5. Integrate with existing operations and error handling
6. Add keyboard shortcuts and message management

Dependencies:
- Existing TUI framework (ratatui)
- Current error handling infrastructure
- UI state management system
- No external dependencies required

## Change Log
