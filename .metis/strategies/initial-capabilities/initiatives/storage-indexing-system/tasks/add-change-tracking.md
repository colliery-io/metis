# Add Change Tracking System

## Parent Initiative

[[Storage & Indexing System]]

## Objective

Implement the change tracking system that records all document modifications, providing audit trails and history for document evolution.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `record_change()` function for capturing document changes
- [ ] `get_document_history()` for retrieving change history
- [ ] `get_recent_changes()` for activity feeds
- [ ] Change type enumeration (Created, Updated, PhaseTransition, etc.)
- [ ] Before/after snapshot storage for frontmatter changes
- [ ] Content hash tracking for detecting actual content changes
- [ ] Automatic change recording integrated with CRUD operations
- [ ] Change summary generation for human-readable descriptions
- [ ] Retention policies for managing history storage size
- [ ] Performance optimization for high-change-volume scenarios
- [ ] Privacy considerations for sensitive change data
- [ ] Unit tests for all change tracking scenarios
- [ ] Integration tests with full document lifecycle

## Implementation Notes

Change tracking components:

1. **Change Recording**:
   ```rust
   async fn record_change(
       document_id: &str,
       change_type: ChangeType,
       details: ChangeDetails
   ) -> Result<()>
   
   enum ChangeType {
       Created,
       Updated, 
       PhaseTransition,
       StatusChange,
       ContentModified,
       FrontmatterUpdated,
   }
   ```

2. **Change History Queries**:
   ```rust
   async fn get_document_history(document_id: &str) -> Result<Vec<ChangeRecord>>
   async fn get_recent_changes(since: DateTime<Utc>) -> Result<Vec<ChangeRecord>>
   ```

3. **Change Data Storage**:
   - Store before/after snapshots of frontmatter
   - Track content hash changes for detecting modifications
   - Include change summaries for human consumption
   - Timestamp and optional user attribution

4. **Integration Points**:
   - Automatic recording in all DocumentStore CRUD operations
   - Integration with sync engine to track file-based changes
   - Hooks for manual change annotation

5. **Performance & Storage**:
   - Efficient storage for large change volumes
   - Configurable retention policies
   - Indexed queries for fast history retrieval
   - Compression for large change records

6. **Privacy & Security**:
   - Option to exclude sensitive data from change logs
   - Proper handling of deletion and redaction
   - Access control considerations for change history

## Status Updates

### 2025-07-03 - COMPLETED

**Decision: Change tracking system removed entirely**

After evaluation, determined that explicit change tracking was unnecessary:

1. **Database CASCADE DELETE** automatically handles cleanup when documents are deleted
2. **CREATE events** are handled by normal document storage in sync engine
3. **Content history** should be managed by external VCS, not application-level tracking
4. **State transitions** (phase/status changes) don't require separate audit trails for MVP

**What we have instead:**
- Sync engine detects file create/modify/delete events
- Database foreign key constraints with CASCADE DELETE handle cleanup
- Document lifecycle is managed through normal CRUD operations
- File modification time tracking prevents over-processing during auto-save

**Result:** Simpler architecture, reduced complexity, same functional outcome.
