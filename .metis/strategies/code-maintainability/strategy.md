# Code Maintainability Strategy

## Problem Statement

The core library has grown organically and is now suffering from architectural debt. The codebase is flat and disorganized, mixing domain logic, components, and utility functions without clear separation of concerns. The current SQLx implementation adds unnecessary complexity and friction to database operations, making the code harder to maintain and extend.

Additionally, the core data model, data flow, and sequence flow of objects through the system need to be revisited to ensure they align with maintainability and clarity goals.

## Success Metrics

- Clear domain boundaries with organized module structure
- Reduced database operation complexity through Diesel adoption
- Improved developer experience with clearer data flow patterns
- Measurable reduction in time-to-understand for new contributors

## Solution Approach

1. **Domain-Driven Organization**: Restructure the core library with clear domain boundaries and organized module hierarchy
2. **Database Layer Modernization**: Replace SQLx with Diesel for more maintainable database operations
3. **Data Flow Redesign**: Revisit and document the core data model and object flow sequences
4. **Incremental Migration**: Implement changes in phases to maintain system stability

## Scope

**In Scope:**
- Core library restructuring and domain organization
- SQLx to Diesel migration
- Data model and flow documentation
- Module boundary definition

**Out of Scope:**
- MCP server architectural changes (separate from core)
	- these are likely to happen later as a consuming application
- External API contract changes
	- acceptable but not ideal
- Performance optimization (focus on maintainability)

## Risks & Unknowns

- Migration complexity may be underestimated
	- acceptable
- Potential breaking changes during restructuring
	- acceptable
- Time investment vs immediate feature development trade-offs
	- acceptable

## Implementation Dependencies

- Complete current integration test stability work
- Establish clear migration strategy and rollback plan
- Team alignment on Diesel adoption
- Documentation of existing data flows before changes

## Change Log

### 2025-07-06 - Initial Strategy
- **Change**: Created initial strategy document
- **Rationale**: Address growing technical debt and improve maintainability after integration test fixes revealed architectural issues
- **Impact**: Baseline established for strategic direction

## Exit Criteria

- [ ] Problem statement is clear and agreed upon
- [ ] Success metrics are measurable and defined
- [ ] Solution approach is sketched at high level
- [ ] Scope boundaries are documented and validated
- [ ] Major risks are identified and assessed
