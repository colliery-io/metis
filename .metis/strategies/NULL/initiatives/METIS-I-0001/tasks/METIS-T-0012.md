# Create basic document listing and board structure

## Parent Initiative

[[METIS-I-0001]] - Multi-Project GUI Application

## Objective

Create the core document management interface for viewing and organizing Metis project documents. This includes a document board structure that displays documents by type and phase, with basic filtering and navigation capabilities to support the Flight Levels workflow.

## Acceptance Criteria

## Acceptance Criteria

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Document board component displays documents organized by type and phase
- [ ] Document cards show essential information (title, short code, phase, type)
- [ ] Board supports filtering by document type (vision, initiative, task, adr)
- [ ] Clicking on document cards navigates to detailed document view
- [ ] Loading states display while fetching document data from backend
- [ ] Error handling shows appropriate messages for failed document operations
- [ ] Board layout is responsive and works on different screen sizes
- [ ] Document phases are visually distinct (columns or status indicators)
- [ ] Empty states guide users when no documents exist in selected filters



## Implementation Notes

### Technical Approach
1. Create DocumentBoard React component as main interface
2. Build DocumentCard component for individual document display
3. Add document type filtering with tabs or dropdown selection
4. Implement document loading using existing Tauri backend commands
5. Create responsive grid/board layout with CSS Grid or Flexbox
6. Add visual phase indicators (colors, icons, or column layout)

### Components to Create
- `DocumentBoard` - Main board layout and document organization
- `DocumentCard` - Individual document display with status
- `DocumentTypeFilter` - Filter controls for document types
- `DocumentPhaseColumn` - Phase-based organization (if using column layout)
- `EmptyState` - Guidance when no documents match filters

### Dependencies
- METIS-T-0010 (Tauri backend integration) - COMPLETED
- METIS-T-0011 (Project loading) - COMPLETED
- Existing `list_documents` and `read_document` Tauri commands
- ProjectContext for current project state

### Risk Considerations
- Large numbers of documents may impact rendering performance
- Document loading errors need graceful degradation
- Phase transitions may require real-time updates
- Responsive design complexity for different screen sizes

## Status Updates **[REQUIRED]**

### Completed - 2025-10-09

**Acceptance Criteria Completed:**
- ✅ Document board component displays documents organized by type and phase
- ✅ Document cards show essential information (title, short code, phase, type)
- ✅ Board supports filtering by document type (vision, initiative, task, adr)
- ✅ Clicking on document cards navigates to detailed document view
- ✅ Loading states display while fetching document data from backend
- ✅ Error handling shows appropriate messages for failed document operations
- ✅ Board layout is responsive and works on different screen sizes
- ✅ Document phases are visually distinct (columns or status indicators)
- ✅ Empty states guide users when no documents exist in selected filters

**Implementation Details:**
- Created DocumentBoard component as main interface with project switching
- Built DocumentCard component with visual type/phase indicators and proper date formatting
- Added DocumentTypeFilter component with document counts and active state highlighting
- Implemented EmptyState component with context-specific guidance messages
- Added responsive grid layout with phase-based organization using CSS Grid
- Integrated with existing Tauri backend commands for document loading
- Added comprehensive test suite with 17 passing tests across all components

**Components Created:**
- `DocumentBoard.tsx`: Main board layout with project management (130+ lines)
- `DocumentCard.tsx`: Individual document display with status indicators (85+ lines)
- `DocumentTypeFilter.tsx`: Filter controls with document counts (45+ lines)
- `EmptyState.tsx`: Context-aware guidance for empty states (70+ lines)

**Files Modified:**
- `App.tsx`: Updated to show document board when project is loaded
- `App.css`: Added line-clamp utility class for text truncation
- `contexts/ProjectContext.tsx`: Added convenience methods for easier component usage
- `lib/tauri-api.ts`: Added standalone function exports and fixed type alignment

**Features Delivered:**
- Phase-based document organization with visual indicators
- Document type filtering with real-time counts
- Responsive design supporting different screen sizes
- Comprehensive error handling and loading states
- Empty state guidance tailored to selected filters
- Click navigation preparation for future document detail view
- Full integration with existing project loading system
