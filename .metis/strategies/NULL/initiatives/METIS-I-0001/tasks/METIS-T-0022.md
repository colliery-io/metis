# Create core-principles.md - Flight Levels fundamentals

*This template includes sections for various types of tasks. Delete sections that don't apply to your specific use case.*

## Parent Initiative **[CONDITIONAL: Assigned Task]**

[[METIS-I-0001]]

## Objective

Create `skill/methodology/core-principles.md` documenting the foundational concepts of Flight Levels methodology that agents need to understand before using Metis tools effectively.

## Content Requirements

The document should cover:

1. **What is Flight Levels** - The "why" behind the hierarchy (Vision -> Strategy -> Initiative -> Task)
2. **Value Flow Direction** - Work flows down (decomposition), feedback flows up (learning)
3. **Time Horizons** - Each level operates at different timescales
4. **The Cache Principle** - Filesystem is source of truth, database is derived
5. **Phase-Gated Progress** - Work advances through phases with exit criteria
6. **Reference to MCP Instructions** - Point to `crates/metis-docs-mcp/instructions.md` for operational details

## Acceptance Criteria

## Acceptance Criteria

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] File created at `skill/methodology/core-principles.md`
- [ ] Explains Flight Levels hierarchy and purpose
- [ ] Describes value/feedback flow directions
- [ ] Covers time horizons for each document type
- [ ] Written for agent consumption (teaches judgment, not procedure)
- [ ] References MCP instructions for tool specifics

## Status Updates

*To be added during implementation*
