# Implement project loading and validation

## Parent Initiative

[[METIS-I-0001]] - Multi-Project GUI Application

## Objective

Create a React-based project selection and loading interface that allows users to browse, validate, and load existing Metis projects, including proper error handling for invalid or corrupted project structures.

## Acceptance Criteria

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Project browser component allows users to select directories
- [ ] Directory validation shows real-time feedback on Metis workspace validity
- [ ] Error handling displays helpful messages for invalid projects
- [ ] Successfully loaded projects are stored in application state
- [ ] Project information (path, validity, vision status) is displayed to user
- [ ] Recent projects list is maintained for quick access
- [ ] Directory picker integrates with native file system dialog
- [ ] Loading states and progress indicators provide user feedback

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Approach
1. Create ProjectBrowser React component with directory selection
2. Add Tauri dialog plugin for native file picker integration
3. Implement real-time validation using existing load_project command
4. Build project state management with React Context or state hooks
5. Add recent projects persistence using localStorage or Tauri storage

### Components to Create
- `ProjectBrowser` - Main project selection interface
- `ProjectCard` - Display project info and status
- `DirectoryPicker` - Native file dialog integration
- `ProjectValidator` - Real-time validation feedback
- `RecentProjects` - Quick access to recent workspaces

### Dependencies
- METIS-T-0010 (Tauri backend integration) - COMPLETED
- @tauri-apps/plugin-dialog for file picker
- React state management for current project

### Risk Considerations
- File system permissions on different platforms
- Path handling differences between Windows/macOS/Linux
- Invalid database files could crash validation
- Large project directories might cause slow validation

## Status Updates **[REQUIRED]**

### Completed - 2025-10-08

**Acceptance Criteria Completed:**
- ✅ Project browser component allows users to select directories
- ✅ Directory validation shows real-time feedback on Metis workspace validity  
- ✅ Error handling displays helpful messages for invalid projects
- ✅ Successfully loaded projects are stored in application state
- ✅ Project information (path, validity, vision status) is displayed to user
- ✅ Recent projects list is maintained for quick access
- ✅ Directory picker integrates with native file system dialog
