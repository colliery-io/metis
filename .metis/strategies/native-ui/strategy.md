# Native UI Strategy

## Problem Statement

**What problem does this solve?**
Currently, Metis operates primarily as a backend system with MCP server integration for agent access. While this provides powerful programmatic capabilities, it lacks a native user interface for humans to:
- Visualize project hierarchies and document relationships as boards
- View and manage work items as kanban boards or task lists
- Track progress across strategies, initiatives, and tasks
- Create and edit documents with rich formatting
- Browse and search the knowledge base intuitively

**Why does this matter?**
A native UI would significantly expand Metis's accessibility and usability by:
- Enabling direct human interaction without requiring agent intermediaries
- Providing visual representations of complex project structures
- Supporting collaborative workflows for teams
- Offering familiar interface patterns (boards, lists, cards) for work management
- Creating a complete product experience that combines powerful backend capabilities with intuitive frontend interaction

## Success Metrics

- Users can visualize all project documents (strategies, initiatives, tasks) as board views within 30 seconds of opening the application
- Users can create, edit, and save strategy documents through the UI with rich text formatting
- Users can drag and drop tasks between phases on kanban boards
- Users can search and filter documents by type, status, and content with sub-second response times
- The UI maintains real-time synchronization with file system changes made through other interfaces (MCP, direct editing)
- User adoption: 80% of project stakeholders actively use the UI for project management tasks

## Solution Approach

**Board-Centric Visualization**: Create a primary interface that presents strategies, initiatives, and tasks as interactive boards with swim lanes organized by phase/status. Users can view the entire project hierarchy at a glance and navigate through different levels of detail.

**Hierarchical Navigation**: Implement a tree-view sidebar and breadcrumb navigation system that reflects the parent-child relationships between documents. Users can drill down from strategies to initiatives to tasks seamlessly.

**Rich Document Editor**: Provide an integrated markdown editor with live preview for creating and modifying strategy documents, initiatives, and tasks. Support for frontmatter editing and template-based document creation.

**Real-time Synchronization**: Build a file system watcher that detects changes made outside the UI and updates the interface in real-time. This ensures consistency across all interaction methods (UI, MCP, direct file editing).

**Progressive Enhancement**: Start with core functionality (viewing, basic editing) and progressively add advanced features (drag-and-drop, advanced search, collaboration features) in subsequent iterations.

## Scope

**In Scope:**
- Board/kanban view for visualizing work items by phase (shaping, design, ready, active, complete)
- Hierarchical tree navigation showing strategy → initiative → task relationships
- Document editor for creating and editing strategy documents, initiatives, and tasks
- Real-time file system synchronization with other interfaces
- Search and filter functionality for document discovery
- Drag-and-drop interface for moving tasks between phases
- Basic project dashboard showing overall progress and status
- Responsive web design for desktop and tablet use
- Integration with existing Metis core document validation and processing

**Out of Scope:**
- Advanced collaboration features (real-time co-editing, comments, mentions)
- Mobile native applications (iOS/Android apps)
- Integration with external project management tools (Jira, Trello, etc.)
- Advanced reporting and analytics beyond basic progress tracking
- User management and permissions system (single-user focus initially)
- Offline functionality and sync capabilities
- Advanced workflow automation and triggers
- Time tracking and resource management features
